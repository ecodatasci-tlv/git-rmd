To follow along, you should have:

- a GitHub account - [create one now](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already!
- git installed and connected to RStudio (detailed installation instructions [here](http://happygitwithr.com/installation-pain.html))

Ask questions and share resources on the [EcoDataSci-TLV Slack](https://ecodatascitlv.slack.com/messages)

# Why learn and use git/GitHub? 

- Version control
- Easy to share/distribute files, especially code/analyses
- Files accessible from anywhere with an internet connection
- Improves collaboration

--

_Git enables time travel & alternate realities!_

# `r fa_git()`

Version control system that lives on your computer. Think "track changes" for files

---
# `r fa_git()` is not

- a full backup
- meant for data, images, etc

git works best with _text-based_ files!

---
# GitHub `r fa_github()`

"Dropbox" for git-based projects on the internet. 

- share/store analyses and functions
- browse past versions of code
- browse source code ([CRAN](https://github.com/cran),  [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/), [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci))
- use packages not on CRAN (`devtools::install_github("account/repo")`)
- host web pages

# GitHub terminology

- **repository** or repo - project/folder `r fa_folder()`
- **local** - files stored on your computer `r fa_file_code()` `r fa_file_image()` `r fa_file_excel()`
- **remote** - files on github.com `r fa_github()`

# Alternative workflow

If you want to work off of an existing repository on GitHub...

1. **Fork a repo** = make a copy of the repo on your account
2. **Make a branch** = start an alternate timeline
3. **Make a change**
4. **Examine the differences**

It's good practice to keep your "master" branch clean so that you can keep it synchronized with the original repository

# What's the deal with projects?

Each project is a self-contained set of files. Projects make it **easy to transfer** files to another computer because its **boundaries are clearly defined**

.center[
<img src="img/project.jpg" width=50% align="center">

# Use relative paths inside projects
 
- looks cleaner
- works for other people/computers

```{r eval = FALSE}
read.csv("data/eilat_survey_2017.csv")
#rather than
read.csv("C:/×—×–×™/phd/thesis/reef_surveys/data/eilat_survey_2017.csv")
```

You never have to use `setwd()` again!

## __What is markdown?__

A lightweight text editor originally built to be presented as html

## __What is Rmarkdowm?__

A __one-stop-shop__ for writing code and sharing your work with various formats

---

# __Type of outputs for Rmarkdown__ 

- Research notebook ([R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html))
- Reports ([html](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html), [pdf](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html), or [word](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html))
- Websites ([RMarkdown website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html)/[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/blogdown-start.html))
- Books ([bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html))

# __The different parts of Rmarkdown__
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecodatasci-tlv/datamanagement/master/rmarkdown/inline-1-heat.png" width=100%></p>

---
## YAML header 

- Must be enclosed in `---`
- output section changes based on the type of ducument

```
---
title: "Edinburgh Biodiversity"
author: John Doe
date: 22/Oct/2016
output: html_document
---
```
---
## Code chunk 

- The chunk must be enclosed with ` ``` `
- `{r}` declares the coding language 
- Keybord shortcut: `ctrl + alt + i` (Windows) or `cmd + alt + i` (MacOS)

<p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/ybpbbe4f" width=100%></p>

---
## __Plain text__

Write everything that isn't code by using markdown symbols to create headers, bold text, etc.

---
## __Workflow of Rmd file__

<p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/ycgusx7u" width=100%></p>

1. You create an Rmd file
2. When you "knit" it with `knitr` package, the Rmd is passed to a rendering package such as pandoc or LaTex, and the final format is created

---
# __Practice time__

1. Open an Rmd file in the project you created before
2. Choose the type of document you want to create
3. Write some plain text and some analyses in the code chunk
4. Click on the knit botton at the top bar

Congradulations!!! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ ðŸ¥³ You created your first Rmd file!! `r emo::ji("smile")`

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# __Rmd plain text syntax__
---

# __Headers__

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```


---
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

---
## Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

```

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------

```

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------

---

# Highlight text



__Bold text__ ` __Bold__` or ` **Bold** `

_Italics_ ` _Italics_ ` or ` *Italics* `

~~strikethrough~~ `~~strikethrough~~`

---

### Use these two links to learn how to adapt the text and the code to your needs:

# __Website__

---

## Files for the website

- Has three files: index.html, index.Rmd, and _site.yml
- The ___site.yml__ is where you configure the top bar of your website and how you nevigate through the pages
- The __index.Rmd__ is where you write the content of your website
-The __index.html__ is updated when you render your website and is used to present it

---

## The YAML header used for it

Here is an example from the website used in our last session
```r

    smooth_scroll: true
    toc_depth: 3
    runtime: shiny_prerendered
    # number_sections: true

```

# __Books__

### - Writen similar to a webslite but has a different YAML header

### - Uses `bookdown` package to generate

# A few tricks

- Use `index.html` to set a home page for your repo: username.github.io/reponame = username.github.io/reponame/index.html
- use `toc_float` to add a floating table of contents to your RMarkdown webpage (more details [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html))

```

# Let's collaborate!
---
# Check-in   

You should have:
- a repository on GitHub 
- an RProject linked to the GitHub repository

---
# Try this!

In your GitHub repo, go into `Settings` --> `Collaborators`.  Add your neighbor as a collaborator

![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/github_collab.png)

---

# Try this!

Switch over to your _neighbor's_ repo:

1. Accept your neighbor's invitation
2. Create a GitHub RStudio project
3. Make a change
4. Pull + stage/commit + push

---
# There's more!  

...but we'll cover these next time.  In the mean time,  check out these resources for step-by-step guides for:

- using `gitignore` to tell git what NOT to track
- dealing with merge conflicts
- collaborating using forks and branches
- burning it all down & starting afresh
